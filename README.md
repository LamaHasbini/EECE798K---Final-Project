# EECE798K---Final-Project
By Lama Hasbini and Tamara Al-Sadek

To reproduce these results, you would need to download or clone the repository before running the notebooks for clustering and classification. All required features are available in the 'features' folder, but you may need to tweak the directories in the code cells to access the copies you downloaded.

This repository contains the following:
- `features/spindle_summaries` and `features/swa_reports`: The objective EEG-derived metrics used for clustering.
- `features/Combined_Features.csv`, `Final_Merged_Sleep_Storm_Spindle_SWA_Summary.xlsx`, `N2N3storms_power_spindles2.xlsx`, and `Patient_Level_Features.csv`: The EDA-related features used in the classification task.
- `patient_cluster_assignments.xlsx`: The output class for each patient using the clustering code.
- `clustering_EEG.ipynb`: A complete notebook detailing the methods used to perform the clustering task.
- `classification_tamara.ipynb`: A complete notebook detailing the methods and results of the classification process.
