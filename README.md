# EECE798K---Final-Project
By Lama Hasbini and Tamara Al-Sadek

To reproduce these results, you would need to download or clone the repository before running ''clustering_EEG.ipynb'' for the clustering results, followed by ''classification_tamara.ipynb'' to classify the patients into the outputted clusters. All needed features are in the "features" folder, but you may need to tweak the directories in all the codes to access the copy you downloaded.
